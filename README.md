# Dotfiles Backup #
Backup of my bash files, because something horrible happened.
Also, it saves me a heap of time when I am feeling peckish and want to re-install my OS, or have (more or less) the same settings across all machines.

## Current Setup (November 2012) ##

* MacBook Pro 15" (Mid 2012)
* MacBook Air 11" (Late 2011)
* White MacBook 13" (Mid 2009)
